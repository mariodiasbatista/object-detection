## ðŸ“– About  
  
With this project i will demo the object detection with a neural network using YOLO it will use simple scenÃ¡rios with images and videos and the result will be a clear compreension how the process works.
Also the dependencies of this project like GPU servers will be addressed on the wiki page, the dependencies are a key part in the process on optimization of the training and inference. 

## âœ¨ Scenarios  

âœ… 1- Train with anotated Images from [Open Images Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/visualizer/index.html) (easy process)

âœ… 2- Train with custom anotated Images from the user (hard process)

âœ… 3- Inference, put the trained model detecting on image 

âœ… 4- Inference, put the trained model detecting on video 

âœ… 5- Check all Results

## ðŸ”§ Installation  
For a quick instalation execute the darknet_compile.sh on yout working dir.
If any issues or error on the Installation see the Wiki on Troubshooting under Instalation Section. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mariodiasbatista/object-detection.git) 
cd object-detection 
./darknet_compile.sh
